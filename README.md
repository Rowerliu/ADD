## Overview
Deep learning is widely applied in computer-aided pathological diagnosis, which alleviates the pathologist workload 
and provide timely clinical analy-sis. However, most models generally require large-scale annotated data for training, 
which faces challenges due to the sampling and annotation scarcity in pathological images. The rapid developing 
generative models shows po-tential to generate more training samples from recent studies. However, they also struggle in
generalization diversity with limited training data, incapable of generating effective samples. Inspired by the 
pathological transitions be-tween different stages, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled diffusion (ADD) network
to generate pathological progressive images for effective da-ta augmentation. This novel approach roots in domain migration,
where a hybrid attention strategy guides the bidirectional diffusion, blending local and global attention priorities. 
With feature measuring, the adaptive depth-controlled strategy ensures the migration and maintains locational similarity 
in simulating the pathological feature transition. Based on tiny training set (samples â‰¤ 500), the ADD yields cross-domain 
progressive images with cor-responding soft-labels. Experiments on two datasets suggest significant im-provements in 
generation diversity, and the effectiveness with generated progressive samples are highlighted in downstream classifications.

## Usage

### Generating a sequence of intermediate images between source domain and target domain
1. Train a diffusion model on your data based on the [guided-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion)<br/>
2. Assign the path of trained models, and then generate intermediate images
(The total diffusion process includes 1000 steps, and we can get 10 intermediate images)<br/>
`python scripts/frequency_generating_m_samples.py --diffusion_steps=1000 --amount=10`
